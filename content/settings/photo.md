2020 was a year of discovery, among other things. One of the hobbies I began that year was photography. I purchased a cheap and used camera to see if I had the eye and passion to capture my world in the photograph  medium. Once I moved to Florida, I took things to the next level and bought a decent camera and lens to fulfill this new found passion. The best of the best photographs I have been able to capture are featured here.

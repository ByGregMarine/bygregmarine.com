Port Richey, Florida, has a few parks that are right on the water. Brasher is a park that is not only on the water, but on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. I frequently launch my kayak from this park. Capturing the beauty of the wildlife and scenery from Brasher brings me much joy. Enjoy these photos of one of my favorite spots.

One of my favorite things about Florida is how the clouds are typically fluffy. As a storm rolls in, the clouds can be especially beautiful. This photo was capture shortly before a storm rolled through.

As a side note, there is a little something in the sky just to the left of the tree in the upper right corner. Zooming in on the original resolution of this photo reveals it is a honey bee!

When I lived in Indiana, I had already seen several Great Blue Herons in my lifetime. Once I moved to Florida, I began seeing a lot more of them. And then I came across this bird. I discovered there was another breed of blue heron...the Little Blue Heron. As the name suggests, it is a smaller bird than the Great Blue Heron. But just as majestic, nonetheless. The time of year I captured this beauty, this one was an immature. By now, it is a full grown adult bird that is a beautiful grey/blue color.

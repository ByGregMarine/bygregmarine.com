When I lived in Indiana, I had already seen several Great Blue Herons in my lifetime. Once I moved to Florida, I began seeing a lot more of them. And then I came across this bird. I discovered there was another breed of heron...the Grey Heron. It is a smaller bird than the Great Blue Heron. But just as majestic, nonetheless.

# Seedling

During my 2021 renaissance, I rented a room in a friend‘s house. The view from my window included a new tree in the neighbor’s yard. Although the painting isn’t much, it was great practice as I took up art once again. Also, this was painted on a very small 2”x2” canvas. Without a magnifying glass, it was quite difficult to do any sort of detail work on this.

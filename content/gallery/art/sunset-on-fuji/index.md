# Sunset on Fuji

This is the first painting I created in my renaissance of 2021. As a part of this period of my life, I was exploring Japanese culture. I was attracted to Mount Fuji for its majestic beauty and its mystery as a volcano. It is an icon of Japanese culture and art. Since I have never been to Japan, I found a reference photograph online to inspire this painting.

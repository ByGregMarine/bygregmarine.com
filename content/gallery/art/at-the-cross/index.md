# At the Cross

I grew up in the church and Christianity has been a major influence in my life. So, it is common for me to "lay" my troubles and mistakes "at the foot of the cross," as Christians might say. This abstract piece shows how I feel Jesus leaning over me and reaching down to give me a hug.

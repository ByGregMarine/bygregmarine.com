# Robert’s Tree

In 2021, I attempted to grow bonsai trees. One of the trees was going to honor my grandfather’s memory. I was going to make a miniature scene with a grandfather and grandson fishing under the tree. It was all about the memories of my late grandfather, Robert Marine, and I fishing when I was a small boy. The tree eventually died and all I had left were photographs of the tree. So I decided to paint the tree from those photos and then gave it to my grandmother as a gift.

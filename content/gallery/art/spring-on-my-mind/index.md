# Spring on My Mind

Spring is my favorite time of year, in general, as it signifies everything springing to life. Growing up in Indiana, I experienced all 4 seasons each year. I was always happiest when it was Spring. And as fate would have it, my birthday is more often than not the first day of Spring!

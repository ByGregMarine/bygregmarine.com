# Happy Little Accident

Shortly after my renaissance in 2021, my sister asked me to paint the famous Spaceship Earth attraction of EPCOT at the Walt Disney World Resort. My first attempt did not go well. So I used the canvas as a testing platform to try different colors and painting techniques. 2 years later, I decided to officially name the canvas and turn it into an official piece of my collection. What began as a seemingly failed painting turned into a work of art! As Bob Ross might say, a “happy little accident.”

Below is the final work that is “Tracy’s Spaceship Earth” that I created for my sister.

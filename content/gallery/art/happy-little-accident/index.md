# Happy Little Accident

Shortly after my renaissance in 2021, my sister asked me to paint the famous Spaceship Earth attraction of EPCOT at the Walt Disney World Resort. My first attempt did not go well. So I used the canvas as a testing platform to try different colors and painting techniques. 2 years later, I decided to officially name the canvas and turn it into an official piece of my collection. What began as a seemingly failed painting turned into a work of art! As Bob Ross might say, a “happy little accident.”

I was looking at this “test” canvas the day I titled it and noticed it was itself a work of art as an abstract expression of several different paintings over the course of a 2 year period. Since it started as a “happy little accident”, that’s what its name became.

Below is the final work that is “Tracy’s Spaceship Earth” that I created for my sister.

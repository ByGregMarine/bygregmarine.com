# Conclusion

These are just the 12 movies I chose at the time. Many of the countries have additional movies based on their culture to choose from. I will be enjoying this concept many times for the rest of my life and will choose different movies each time; with the exception of countries which only have 1 or a few movies that represent their culture. Sometimes with cartoons and sometimes live action. This concept can also be applied to each of the 3 other parks from the Walt Disney World Resort. The Magic Kingdom has many attractions that have movie counterparts. Disney's Hollywood Studios has Star Wars, Toy Story, and Indiana Jones, to name a few. And Disney's Animal Kingdom has many areas such as Africa, Asia, and Dinosaur Land USA which all have movies that will fit them well.

This is one of many new habits and coping mechanisms I acquired during the events of 2020. And this is certainly one I want to share with others. Any Disney fan who loves the Walt Disney World Resort as I do will definitely find this to be an entertaining way to enjoy the magic from home. I'm really looking forward to expand this idea to the other parks and would love to hear how others apply this.

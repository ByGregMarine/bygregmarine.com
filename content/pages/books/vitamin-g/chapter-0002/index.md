> *Working hard is important when the job needs done. But what does hard work look like? Today, it might be crushing that task list. But tomorrow, it might just be relaxing to prepare for the next busy day. Working hard does not mean crushing it everyday. Be sure to relax when working hard! Otherwise you might burn out.*

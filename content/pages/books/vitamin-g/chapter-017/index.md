> Never mind worrying about what is in store for tomorrow...today is a perfect day to seize!

I often look back on my life and ponder what sort of life I would have now if certain events of my past had turned out differently. Back in the day, my life was recorded on what was known as VHS tapes. Then it became digital tapes which did not really have a any other way of playing than from the camera it was recorded from. Now, photos and videos are taken from what we call mobile phones.

Reviewing the tapes, and now digital files in the cloud, I tend to be reminded of where I am from or what I was in the past. Honestly, it has very little impact on what I truly think of myself. My memories stored in my brain have more impact than anything. Some of the images in my mind are quite blurry these days. However, some of the images are definitely quite clear!

Regardless where the images and videos come from, everything I’ve been through does have an influence on my future. As I review the events and choices of my life, I can begin to shape where I am going. The trajectory I have to look forward to has almost entirely been forged by the past I have led. This is actually the case for everyone, really.

However, how do I best apply lessons learned from my past? The answer is not as obvious as one would think. Honestly, it has taken me more than four decades to figure out how to apply any sort of lessons I had learned. To the young, I would encourage you to be patient. To the more seasoned ready, I would also encourage you to know it is never truly too late to learn from your past.

I truly believe the key to learning from one’s past is to apply lesson’s learned to now. That’s right! Now is a great time to begin taking what you have learned from the past and apply it to your life. Honestly, it should not come as a surprise. No one should be anchored to their past. And no one should be so focused on their future that they do not live today.

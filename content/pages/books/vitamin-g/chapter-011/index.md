> *Nearly 10 years ago, I learned that failure is the key to success. The concept is simple: build upon what I think I am failing at and turn it into a success; never giving up! Never give up. You're never a failure if you don't give up.*

In my life, it has been quite rare that anything I do is successful the first time I try it. I’ve burnt my fair share of food, and I have skinned my knee a time or two. In my career, I have had to resign and I have lost a few jobs along the way. And if that was not enough, as of this writing, I am three times divorced.

Have you heard of the mobile game Angry Birds? There is a good chance you have considering its great success along with follow up games, movies, and toys. Did you know there were 51 games created by Rovio, the company behind Angry Birds, before it reached the number 1 spot on the Apple App Store? Let me repeat that: there were 51 games that did not make it big before Angry Birds became the hit it is!

You also likely know the vague stories of the invention of the electric lightbulb. Although Thomas Edison did not invent the electric light, he and his associates did create what became the modern electric light. The primary issue with the light in those early days was finding the right material that could produce light for hours while also being fiscally viable. Edison and his associated tested thousands of materials before finally coming across carbonized bamboo in the final product.

What do Rovio and Edison’s team have in common? They did not give up! In order to find their success, they went through many, what some would call, failures. The truth is, however, what seemed like failures were actually stepping stones to success. And by not giving up, both teams achieved something which revolutionized their industries in ways no one else could have at the time.

As for me, not giving up has led to my being known for home culinary arts, telling of dad jokes, and being a successful software engineer. Not to mention my writings and paintings. There were many times I wanted to just give up on these passions. Each time the temptation to quit came to my heart, I would recall the many times perseverance led to much success.

Yes, there will be times in life where one must cut their losses and no longer pursue a path simply because it is not meant to be. What I’m saying is that if you have a true goal, do not lose heart when you fall along the path. Keep giving it your all and what seems like failures will become sweet stepping stones to the success you will have earned.

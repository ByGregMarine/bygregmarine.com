> I have found that in order to do the things we want to do, we must also do a lot of things we don’t want to do. But knowing we will get to do the things we want to do, it makes it easier and more enjoyable to do the things we don’t.

One of the most seemingly rhetorical statements I have ever made to my son has been, “We have to do the things we don’t want to do in order to do the things we do want to do.”  When I have told him this, it was almost always at a time when he did not want to do something. 

The simple truth is, I am more like my son in this area than I really care to admit. I cannot count how many times I really did not want to do something. And in some instances, I honestly did not do whatever the “thing” was. No matter how old I get, there seems to always be moments when I feel it is not worth the effort to do certain tasks and responsibilities.

However, I can with full confidence say that it all does become well worth it when it leads to my being able to do those life fulfilling activities I really do want to do. It could be something as simple as having food to eat. Or it could be something such as enjoying a fun hobby. How does a nice vacation sound? All of those things are worth almost anything I do that I don’t want to.

Going to work, cleaning my home, paying taxes, and various other tasks I must do, I’ll gladly do. \[expand on that]

> I find very few things in life that give me greater pleasure than seeing my friends and loved ones succeed.

As I have gained friends over the years, I've really enjoyed supporting them in their passions. When I was in school, this took the form of cheering on classmates in their various sporting events or attending music recitals and performances. As an adult, this has translated into encouraging my friends and family to reach their goals or explore their hobbies. Seeing my friends and family succeed has brought me inexplicable joy.

In the chapter *[“Believe in Yourself,”](/pages/vitamin-g/chapter-005/)* I talked about how my parents taught me how to believe in who I am. This easily translates into helping others believe in themselves as well. As I would support others in their passions, they begin to believe in themselves. This overall positive attitude towards each other can certainly lead to a perpetual flow of energy that will truly help each other find great success in life.

Take this book, for example. It all began with some encouraging social media posts I started writing after the most difficult year in most everyone’s lives. I would inject positive vibes into the feeds of hundreds of people to help motivate them in their pursuit of happiness each day as they dealt with a pandemic. Their responses gave me such a positive attitude that I was able to begin replying to their other social media posts to encourage them in all other aspects of their lives. And in turn, their appreciation of my good vibes penetrating their world ultimately led to me writing this book.

Negativity can be a powerful thing. But I honestly believe that positivity can be equally, if not more, powerful when applied in this manner. It is incredibly easy to feed off negative energy and emotion. Indeed, that is obvious when you turn on the news or following controversial topics on social media. On the other hand, I find it can be just as easy to feed off positive energy and emotion when I believe in others.

The only truly difficult part is knowing where to start. I would encourage you to start with finding someone who is working hard at meeting a certain goal and be their biggest cheerleader. I can almost guarantee that person will not only appreciate you for it, but they will also grow from that positive vibes you are pouring into them. And as they succeed in accomplishing their goal, you will feel a sense of pleasure knowing how much you believed in them.

After that, do it again! And then do it again! And DO IT AGAIN! Never stop believing in others. Allow yourself to become a super fan for all those around you. Not everyone will return the favor. However, there will be enough of those people believing in you to keep it going. This positivity flow will grow each person in ways not previously imagined. This has worked out well in my own life. So much so that I don’t always have to be positive at every moment. I still have my moments of weakness when negativity creeps in. But due to believing in others and pouring positivity into them, there is usually someone there to pick me back up!

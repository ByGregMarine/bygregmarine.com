> Celebrate everything positive in your life. Whether it is something huge, or something small, everything positive is worth celebrating. There are so many negative influences in our lives. It is time to show the negative it does not own us.

> Celebrate all of the wins in your life. Even if it is a small win, a win is a win! There is enough tragedy, trauma, and drama in our lives to make every win worth celebrating! And while you are at it, celebrate someone else's win today!

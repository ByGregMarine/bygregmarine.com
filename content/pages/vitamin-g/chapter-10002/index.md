> I have news for you... You aren't perfect! None of us are! The good news is, life itself isn't perfect. So stop trying to be! Be ok with the fact you are good enough. Sure, you should still try to become better. You'll get there. But today, you are good enough!

Counseling when I tried to compare myself to others...like my brother. He told me to just compare myself to who I wanted to be. That it is ok to accept "Good enough" instead of what I thought was perfection.

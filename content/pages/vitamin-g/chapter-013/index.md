> There is a version of you in the future that you are striving to become. Look forward to meeting that person because they are even more amazing than you are today. Consider yourself a work in progress. You'll get there!

Sometime in my mid to late twenties, my dad invited my brother, brother-in-law, and myself on a quick mountain bike trip. My dad had been riding for years and wanted to take his three sons out on the trails. My brother was in pretty good shape. However, my brother-in-law and I weren't in the best of shape physically. So, dad took us on the easiest trail available at Brown County State Park near Nashville, Indiana. I'll say it was a pretty easy trail. But deep down, I have to admit that I was still quite anxious about it! Having spent years in the tech field, eating tons of junk food, and drinking quite a bit of Mountain Dew, to say I was out of shape was an extreme understatement!

One of my dad's buddies, Cool Dude Ron, joined us for this adventure. One of Cool Dude Ron's pieces of advice was to look about 15 feet ahead of you on the trail to see what was ahead and prepare for it. Doing so helps you see the hills, valleys, and turns throughout the trail in plenty of time to know how you should handle what is just head. Do not look straight down and do not look so far ahead that you miss what you are about to come across. For the first part of the trail, I found it quite easy to follow this advice. But then I came to a narrow rock formation that I had to cross. My gaze quickly focused on that narrow target so that I would not miss it. All of a sudden, my bike and I were no longer moving forward! I crashed right into a tree just on the other side of those rocks.

In the chapter, Be Kind to Yourself [add a link], I mentioned how I should only compare myself to who I want to be tomorrow and just do what I need to today to become who I want to be tomorrow. One of the key factors in that concept is that I should also never fixate on just how I am right now. And likewise, looking too far into my future will keep me from seeing what it is just ahead. I've been asked, "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" I've never really been able to answer that one. For most of my life, I've focused completely on the here and now. Sure, I've worried about the future. And, yes, we should all prepare for retirement should we live long enough to retire. However, for too often I only did what was necessary to survive in the moment without any regard to how it was going to affect my future.

After crashing into that tree, I quickly realized what I had done. I fixated on something I had already seen and did not look ahead to see that the trail turned left immediately after that narrow rock formation. I would have avoided the tree altogether I had stuck with the 15 foot advice Cool Dude Ron gave me. The good news, that is ok. The bike broke and I had to carry it a mile or so out of the woods. But I learned a lesson that day. I'm a work in progress! I picked myself up, evaluated the situation, and I've never made that mistake again. Everyone who was there that day joined me for the laugh that the situation was. In the moment, I forgot about the 15 foot rule. After that moment, I looked "15 feet" ahead and realized I was learning something.

More often than not, my failures have been caused by not looking just a little bit ahead. I tend to focus only on the here and now and I how I feel in the moment.

You will have successes and failures throughout your life. That just comes with living. Know that you are a work in progress who is making progress. Keep moving forward and you will become a version of yourself that is more amazing tomorrow than you are today.

> Be kind to yourself today. No one else knows what you have been going through. And in many ways, you may not truly understand what you are going through.

Childhood depression
- Early sadness
- Empathy
- Unreasonable expectations of myself

Adulthood depression
- Move to Illinois with young family
- Time in mental hospitals
- Suicide attempt

Ok to feel the all the feelings
- Tell yourself it is ok to feel
- Accept not understanding
- Ask for help, it's ok!

> *If you look back, you'll soon be going that way. Learn from the past, but keep moving forward!*

I’m going to be completely honest with you. I have spent quite a bit of my life dwelling on my past. Many of the moments of my life are worth spending some time meditating over. Being human, it is in my nature to actually focus on those moments which are not worth giving time to, however. Yes, I should definitely be learning from all of the bad times. But why allow them to anchor me to the past?

Those closest to me, and now you, know I have been married multiple times. Each marriage ended in divorce, unfortunately. In each marriage, both of us contributed to the failure of the relationship. However, I mostly dwell on on my side of the failure. It is so easy to focus on what I could have done better and differently to make everything work out. However, no amount of dwelling and reflection will solve those past problems.

What I have learned to do is apply what I “should have done” to future relationships. After stating that, I’m sure you are wondering, “If you apply what you learned, why then do you keep getting divorced?” The answer is simple: all relationship are different. That means I make all new mistakes in future relationships. And that is ok. I’m here to tell you that mistakes do not define you or me. So long as we learn from those mistakes and do not repeat them, we are still moving forward.

I have no idea what future relationships I’ll have. What I do know is that those relationships will be built on lessons learned from my own perspective. And I’m not just talking about romantic relationships. My experiences in broken marriages have actually helped with friendships and business relationships. These experiences have opened my mind to begin looking at the perspectives of others. Nothing is what it seems on the surface. There is always something else behind every disagreement. So, the ultimate lesson I have learned is simply to listen to understand the other person’s point of view.

Similar to failed marriages, I have also had more than my fair share of work relationships end with burned bridges. I work in the software development industry. A typical employment opportunity for a software developer, or engineer, is not more than six or so years. That isn’t to say there are some developers or engineers who stay with the same employer their entire careers. However, I’m one who has worked for more than ten employers in my career. Many of those employment opportunities ended without pomp and circumstance. However, there were multiple times when things could have ended much better.

I vividly recall one such dissolution of employment in which I felt so strongly I was right about my side of a conflict that I resigned in protest. I had been asked to refrain from saying “God Bless” or including a religious symbol such as the “<><“ Jesus Fish emoji when signing my emails. The company began with a basic request to cease the action. However, it quickly escalated to disciplinary actions when I did not cease. My position was that I had the religious right to continue to do so. I could not have been more wrong.

In that situation, the offense I was causing was with company messages and owned email systems. As a member of management, and company representative, the company had every legal right to restrict what I said in emails. As I did not wish to put the company through any more turmoil over the matter, I resigned. Looking back on the events that led up to this, and all of the events which occurred during, I can safely say that I was in the wrong at the time.

What can be learned from failed marriages and employment decisions? Everything! Even if you repeat history with relationships, or anything for that matter, it is ok. The key to understanding these mistakes is to keep moving forward. In fact, I can assure you that you are moving forward today. You are reading this book! I shared a glimpse into my worst experiences so that you can learn from yours. If you weren’t reading this, you might not be moving forward yourself. However, I know for a fact you are moving forward. The pages of this book are helping. How do I know? You are reading this book! No matter how you came to know about my book, it means you aren’t ready to give up just yet.

I fully endorse looking to your past. When you do, learn from it and move forward with those lessons learned. In fact, I would say embrace your best. It makes you who you are today. Those experiences shape what makes you…you! Just do not dwell on the past. Do not allow it to bring you down. Own it and move on. I gave a few extreme examples to nail my point. However, even the little mistakes of our past can be lessons learned. Learn from everything in your past. But keep moving forward!

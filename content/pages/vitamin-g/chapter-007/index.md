> *When it rains upstream, it can flood downstream. Likewise, what I do affects those around me down the road. It is important to me to do the best I can today to affect them in a positive way. I want the flood to be that of joy and not of sorrow.*

Through a series of unfortunate events, I learned quite a while ago how my own actions effect everyone around me. And years later, I found that how it effected them in turn had an impact on everyone else around them. As of this writing, I’m in my 40s. So, as an adult, I have had an impact on more people than I can even imagine. There have now been more decades in my adult years than my childhood. It can be an overwhelming thought that my actions and consequences have effected so many.

I once worked on a contract for a prominent North American transmission manufacturer who supplied all of the transmissions for every school bus in the United States of America. This same company also supplied transmissions for tanks for the USA military. While I worked on that contract, I soon realized the work I was doing was actually affecting everyone on the planet in some way.

Being a vendor for a company who designed all of the bus transmissions for school buses for the United States of America school systems was a huge responsibility I did not take lightly. The particular software system I was tasks to help design and enhance was for fuel economy. Their customers relied on the data coming from my application to make decisions about configuring the product to their needs. And those decisions directly affected all of the children who went to public school in the nation. This in turn had a impact on their parents. Many of those parents are involved with every other aspect of the nation’s economy and industries.

You see, if I didn’t show up to work and do my very best, it would have an impact and direct affect on all school children and their parents. Those impact and affects would then impact and affect everyone else they impacted or affected. At some point in my time with this company, I can say I had an affect, or impact, on every single citizen of the United States of America. If you think that is a bit of a stretch, I would implore you to research the company who supplies the most transmissions to school buses in North America.

Throughout my career, I have worked with or for companies who have a direct impact on people’s lives. This has taught me that when I do my work, it isn’t just about me, or even about my employer. Everything I do has an impact on others. This hold true in my personal life as well. The decisions I make in my personal life can impact, or affect, my family and friends. No matter what I do, it does not just affect me. This is not as much of a burden as it is a responsibility.

The realization I do not just affect myself has brought me to a point in my life where I can honestly say I am not alone. Social media, traffic jams, a day at the office, or a dip in the pool can have a ripple effect on everyone. What I do can impact everyone in the end. Everything I say can lift someone up or tear someone down. Showing up to work does not only pay the bills, it gives someone else what they need. When I go to the beach to relax, I come back to reality to give what someone needs to do what they do best.

As important as it is to be the best version of yourself to help others, it is equally important to take care of yourself. None of what I have said is possible if I do not take good care of me. So, all that I have said in this chapter also applies to when I take breaks I need. When you need time away from the norm, you are recharging yourself to become what the world needs you to be. Taking care of yourself is just as important as doing your job. If you have every flown in a commercial airplane, you have been told to put on your oxygen mask before helping someone else with theirs. The same is true with life in general. You have to take care of you before you can care for anything else. So, taking care of yourself is in turn taking care of those around you.

What does all of this mean for you. I really do not know. This book is not about answering questions as much as it is helping you ask the questions you need to ask yourself. What do you do that affects others around you? When is it best to take time for you and when is it the best time to help someone else? When should you work or when should you take a vacation or holiday? Only you know the answer to those questions. But you do affect everyone around you. So, be sure to ask yourself those questions. And be confident in the answers. You, and those around you, depend on it.

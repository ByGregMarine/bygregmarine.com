I started my Vitamin G posts based on the concept of the fortune cookie. As I continued to evolve the concept, it grew into what is now known as Vitamin G; or tiny bits of motivational wisdom and encouragement from my own experiences.

In an effort to live on and with purpose, I began to document many of the thoughts that motivate me. It began on Twitter and became an important part of all the social media platforms I engage on.

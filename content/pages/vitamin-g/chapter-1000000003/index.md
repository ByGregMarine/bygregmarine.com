> Working hard is important when the job needs done. But what does hard work look like? Today, it might be crushing that task list. But tomorrow, it might just be relaxing to prepare for the next busy day. Working hard does not mean crushing it everyday. Be sure to relax when working hard! Otherwise you might burn out.

Iâ€™ve been working for a living for about three decades now. And of those three decades, most of the time it has been as a software professional. Although the work that goes into software development isn't nearly as difficult as say, being a nurse in an ICU, I have had months where the job required 80 or more hours per week to get accomplished. I don't say that to garnish any sympathies. I'm merely painting a picture that I have had to work harder than I would have liked at times.

Often times, our bosses ask us to work long and hard hours to get the job done. The bottom line does not always take into account your personal time or energy levels.

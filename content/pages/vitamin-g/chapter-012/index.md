> Your world has a certain level of expectation for you. It is most likely too high. Instead, you should set your own level of expectation. Show your world what it should be expecting from you. Listen to your soul and show others how to listen to it as well.

Universal Morality
- Do not kill
- Do not steal
- Respect
- Religion

From a very young age, we are all exposed to expectation. It might be the rules of our household set by our parents. It could be classroom rules set by our teachers. We are told such things as sit up straight or finish eating everything on our plate. Be quiet, go to bed, chew with your mouth closed, be on your best behavior. No matter where you have come from, I think it is a safe bet someone who has been responsible for or had some sort of authority over you has told you what they expected from you. It may not have been directly spoken, but you sure knew what was expected.

As we grow older, those expectations can change or evolve. But the meaning behind it all is most likely universal. And as adults, a sense of universal morality begins to take over. We shouldn't steal, we should never lie, and we most certainly should not be going around killing each other. Those are the kinds of expectations we should all have for one another, right? What about trust? What about respect? Are those something we should all just expect from each other? Perhaps. But what if those are expectations that should be earned first? Are we expected to just trust and respect everyone? The answers to those questions may not be as easy as yes or no. And if someone is expecting those from you regardless if you know them, they might be sitting a bit too high.

Parent's Expectations
- Children obey teachings
- Learn
- Right vs. wrong
- Do their best vs. being THE best (youth basketball coaches)

Before I go into that, let me take you back to my childhood for a moment. I was raised by two very loving parents in a family where I had wonderful grandparents, aunts and uncles, and many cousins. As a child, I was taught about the house rules and why I should obey them. And of course, anytime I did not obey, there would be consequences. But they were teaching me right from wrong. None of the rules of the house, nor the consequences for disobeying them, were harsh in any way. Everything my parents did was a way for them to prepare me for being a contributing member of society and earn my place in this world.

That said, like any other child who has existed, I did not always agree with my parents. As a young adult, I did not heed all of their teaching and ran into financial troubles. I did not always have a new job lined up when I quit a few jobs. And I always trusted people the moment I met them. Oh, did I forget to mention what my parents said about trust? One of the most fundamental lessons my father taught me was to never give my trust freely. He was adamant that everyone must earn my trust. I, however, felt that people should be trusted and could only lose my trust after they gave me a reason not to trust them. This contradiction in views led to quite a few instances where I allowed my world to expect more out of me than I it.

Self Expectations
- Be reasonable
- Say no
- Respect
- "Do unto others as you'd have them do to you"

Be setting the expectation of universal trust, I opened the door to some rather unpleasant circumstances. There were people in my life, whom I trusted from the moment I met them, that took advantage of my skills and abilities without respect for my time and energy. They expected me to always drop what I was doing and do whatever it was they needed me to do. And along with my trusting them, I thought I was respecting them by doing whatever it was they wanted. This always left me powerless and, quite frankly, under their complete control. My world's expectations of me went way beyond what I was able to give and I didn't do what was necessary to stop it. When I was finally broken, I lost trust and respect for most of my world.

Thankfully, I had friends and family who did respect me enough to allow me to go through that. That seems like a funny statement, but hear me out! Had anyone stepped in to try and show me what was going on, I would have rejected them. Remember, I had already rejected a fundamental lesson from my father. And that contradiction would have fueled my resistance to hearing the truth. When I was finally broken, guess who was there to help me rebuild? Those family members and friends, whom did respect me, were there with open arms.

Although my father hasn't always been right, he was in this case. Trust should always be earned. And the best way to show someone I can be trusted is by setting my own expectations of myself. I can only do so much for this world. I need to listen to my body to know when I need to eat, rest, and exercise. I need to listen to my soul to know what I want out of life. I need to listen to wisdom that comes from those who know more than I do and from my own experiences. I need to be ok with saying no when I just can't do what is asked. And I need to treat others with that same respect. Although trust should be earned, respect is something I should be giving to anyone until they do something to lose it. If that happens, it is time to walk away until they come back broken.

Listen to your soul today. What is it telling you? Discover what you should be expecting from yourself. When you do so, be reasonable. Do not set your own expectations too high. Instead, say no when you need to. You definitely want to set some boundaries for yourself. Respect those boundaries and your world be forced to as well. Communicate with your world about what they can expect from you. And never compromise on any of this. Once your world has earned your trust, you'll know who is expecting you to just be you.

> Be kind to yourself today. No one else knows what you have been going through. And in many ways, you may not truly understand what you are going through.

Childhood depression
- Early sadness
- Empathy
- Unreasonable expectations of myself

If you are anything like me, you are absolutely your worst critic. I haven't a clue when this started for me, but as far back as I can remember, I have always been way to hard on myself. Even with the support of family and friends, I would hardly ever feel like I had done my best in most activities. I couldn't sing well, my art was always horrible, and I was never good enough. At least, that is what I always thought! And no amount of praise from anyone could change how I felt about myself. I had a strong tendency to see other people doing better than me. This left me with a sense of sadness. These unreasonable expectations of myself were all I could see.

For a few years of my elementary school days, I had a bully. Day in and day out, that kid would torment me both physically and verbally. Due to my low self esteem, I just felt like I deserved this abuse. I don't even recall ever telling my teachers or parents about what was going on. Then one day, while walking between the high school and our elementary school buildings, he told me something I found quite odd. He straight up told me, "I'm doing this to you to make you a stronger person." That was the last time he ever abused me and we became friends until our paths took us in different directions.

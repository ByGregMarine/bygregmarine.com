> The sun rises and sets on all of us. I am no better than the next person. But I will be the best me that I can be!

Let's face it, competition can be a lot of fun. Everything from sports to the fine arts, there are more than enough ways to compete with other people who share similar interests. Although I have been involved with competitions most of my life, I'm not actually much of a competitive person in the typical sense. The type of competition I have mostly engaged in was comparing myself to other people.

It seems to be human nature to compare ourselves to others. It may start with thoughts about how we want to be that other person or have what they have. And it may end with us trying to be better than them in someway. This is definitely not restricted to competitive sports or the arts. Envy and jealousy can creep into any situation.

To be absolutely honest, I use to resent other's success. There was a time in my life when I wanted to be more successful than someone else in those things I was most interested in. I would even go so far as to sabotage their efforts. I recall on instance where a good friend of mine was interested in being a part of a project I was working on for a Christian band. When this friend reached out to me, my response was, "You aren't Christian enough to be a part of this project."

At the time, my pride was really getting in the way. Not only for the project, but more importantly, in how I was building a wall between myself and this friend. What my pride was hiding from me was that I was the one who wasn't "Christian enough" to working on the project. Sure, I was pretty good at what I did. But this friend I crushed was probably better than I was in what needed to be accomplished. He certainly was a better friend than I was being at the time.

We have since reconciled what had happened and I came clean when he first brought it up to me years later. It was a phase of my life where I can honestly say I was not a very good person. And I was definitely not being the best I could be. The lessons my friend taught me long after this were such things as grace, mercy, and humility. I really am no better than anyone else. And the fact of the matter is, the sun rises and sets on us all. Even the rain falls on all of us no matter who we are.

Now, I celebrate other's success. The person I am competing with today is who I was yesterday. Each day, I try to be a little bit better than I was the day before. I have come quite a long way from that person I was decades ago. Healthy competition in a controlled environment, such as in a sporting event, is perfectly fine. But be sure to leave that competitive person out on the field. And as for me, the only person I'm better than now is that old me who thought he was better than everyone.

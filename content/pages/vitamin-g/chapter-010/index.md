> The sun rises and sets on all of us. I am no better than the next person. But I will be the best me that I can be!

Let's face it, competition can be a lot of fun. Everything from sports to the fine arts, there are more than enough ways to compete with other people who share similar interests. Although I have been involved with competitions most of my life, I'm not actually much of a competitive person in the typical sense. The type of competition I have mostly engaged in was comparing myself to other people.

It seems to be human nature to compare ourselves to others. It may start with thoughts about how we want to be that other person. And it may end with us trying to be better than them in someway. This is definitely not restricted to competitive sports or the arts. Envy and jealousy can creep into any situation.

I use to resent other's successes...now I celebrate them

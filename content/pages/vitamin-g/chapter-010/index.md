> The sun rises and sets on all of us. I am no better than the next person. But I will be the best me that I can be!

Let's face it, competition can be a lot of fun. Everything from sports to the fine arts, there are more than enough ways to compete with other people who share similar interests. Although I have be involved with competitions most of my life, I'm not actually much of a competitive person in the typical sense. The type of competition I have mostly engaged in was comparing myself to other people.

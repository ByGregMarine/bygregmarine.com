Rare, yet it comes

Not like a thief in the night

So much warning, yet it comes

I know just what to do

Anxiety creeps in

I do all that I'm supposed to do

Pre-programmed like a cellphone

She comes...asking for everything I am

Still, I work and I work

Georgia in my glass

"Alfred" on the screen

Nicole passes and I reject her

Nicole passes and she cannot touch me

Nicole, I love you

Nicole, I am not yours

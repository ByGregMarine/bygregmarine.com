ingredients:
  - qty: "4"
    ingredient: skinless chicken breast halves
    note: I typically cut a chicken breast in half like I would when doing a
      butterfly cut; except all the way through. So 2 large chicken breasts is
      what I use.
  - ingredient: freshly ground salt and pepper to taste
    note: Does not need to be freshly ground. I just think it tastes better that way.
  - qty: "2"
    unit: large
    ingredient: eggs
  - qty: "1"
    unit: cup(s)
    ingredient: crackers mashed into crumbs
    note: I use club crackers. You can also use bread crumbs. Club crackers just
      have that taste I was going for!
  - qty: "1"
    unit: cup(s)
    ingredient: grated parmesan
  - qty: 1/4
    unit: cup(s)

    unit: cup(s)

  - instruction: Cook chicken in olive oil for 1-2 minutes each side to crisp up the
      breading
  - instruction: Place chicken in baking dish and spoon some pasta sauce over each piece
  - instruction: Bake for 15 to 20 minutes
    note: Until internal temp reaches 165F
  - instruction: While the chicken is baking, heat up remaining sauce and boil pasta
    note: Optional if you are preparing pasta as a side
  - instruction: Pull chicken out of the oven and turn broiler to high
  - instruction: ayer each chicken breast with equal amounts of shredded mozzarella
      and parmesan, parsley, and basil

      drizzle olive oil

  - instruction: Serve each piece of chicken with a small pile of pasta with a
      topping of sauce
    note: Or other side, or no side at all! It's up to you!
notes: This serves 4, or 2 really hungry people. Substitute spaghetti for any
  pasta type, or omit the pasta if you prefer the chicken parmesan by itself.
  For a low carb alternative, you can substitute pork rinds for the crackers and
  zucchini, or similar, noodles.

I use to judge a restaurant by its Chicken Parmigiana. In fact, there are a few places, none of which can I even recall their names now, that I have not been to since having a bad experience with this dish. As 2020 was "that" kind of year, I decided it was time to develop my own recipe of my favorite dish. This is that recipe! Once you've made it, feel free to judge my culinary skills!

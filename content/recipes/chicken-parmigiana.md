I use to judge a restaurant by its Chicken Parmigiana. In fact, there are a few places, none of which can I even recall their names now, that I have not been to since having a bad experience with this dish. As 2020 was "that" kind of year, I decided it was time to develop my own recipe of my favorite dish. This is that recipe! Once you've made it, feel free to judge my culinary skills!

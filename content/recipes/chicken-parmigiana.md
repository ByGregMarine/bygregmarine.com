ingredients:
  - qty: "4"
    ingredient: skinless chicken breast halves
    note: I typically cut a chicken breast in half like I would when doing a
      butterfly cut; except all the way through. So 2 large chicken breasts is
      what I use.
  - ingredient: freshly ground salt and pepper to taste
    note: Does not need to be freshly ground. I just think it tastes better that way.
  - qty: "2"
    unit: large
    ingredient: eggs
  - qty: "1"
    unit: cup(s)
    ingredient: crackers mashed into crumbs
    note: I use club crackers. You can also use bread crumbs. Club crackers just
      have that taste I was going for!

I use to judge a restaurant by its Chicken Parmigiana. In fact, there are a few places, none of which can I even recall their names now, that I have not been to since having a bad experience with this dish. As 2020 was "that" kind of year, I decided it was time to develop my own recipe of my favorite dish. This is that recipe! Once you've made it, feel free to judge my culinary skills!

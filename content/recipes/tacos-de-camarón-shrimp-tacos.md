One of my favorite places on Earth is the Most Magical Place on Earth, the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. And my favorite park at the resort is EPCOT. With a multitude of countries represented in the World Showcase, it is a foodie's paradise! For this recipe, we are entering the World Showcase and turning left into the Mexico Pavilion. Upon entering the pavilion, we quickly come to La Cantina de San Angel. At this location, you can choose from many entrées ranging from nachos to tacos. For me, I'm going to choose tacos! Specifically, Tacos de Camarón, or shrimp tacos. This recipe is inspired by that delicious option at EPCOT.

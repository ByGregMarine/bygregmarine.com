  - qty: "3"
    unit: tbsp(s)
    ingredient: Salsa Verde
  - qty: "6"
    unit: tbsp(s)
    ingredient: Mango salsa
    note: Any salsa will do. But I've found the best flavor from mango or
      mango-peach salsa.
instructions:
  - instruction: Put flour in a bowl and set aside
  - instruction: Beat egg in a second bowl and set aside
  - instruction: Combine corn meal, parmesan cheese, and paprika in a third bowl and
      set aside
  - instruction: Pat dry all of the shrimp (I typically just use a few layers of
      paper towel on a plate)
    note: ""
  - instruction: Coat each shrimp with flour, then dip in egg, and coat with corn
      meal/parmesan cheese/paprika mix
  - instruction: If using store bought corn tortillas, cook each on a comal (or
      frying pan) on medium to medium-high heat for 1-1.5 mins each side until
      golden
    note: ""
  - instruction: If sautéing slaw/cabbage, heat up olive oil in pan on medium heat
      and sauté to desired texture (Optional step if you prefer raw)
  - instruction: Just before sauté step is complete, place the tortillas over
      slaw/cabbage in a single layer (This is optional. I like to do this to
      warm the tortillas before building the tacos.)
    note: ""
  - instruction: Place tortillas on a plate and put equal amounts of slaw/cabbage on
      each tortilla
  - instruction: Heat vegetable oil in frying pan on medium heat
  - instruction: Fry breaded shrimp in vegetable oil for 1 minute each side
  - instruction: Place 4 shrimp evenly on each taco
  - instruction: Apply 1 tbsp of salsa verde on each taco
  - instruction: Apply 2 tbsp of mango salsa on each taco
notes: You can use pre-made tortillas, slaw mix, salsa verde, and mango salsa.
  Or you can make your own! I prefer to sauté the slaw. But you can skip those
  steps if you prefer your veggies raw.

One of my favorite places on Earth is the Most Magical Place on Earth, the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. And my favorite park at the resort is EPCOT. With a multitude of countries represented in the World Showcase, it is a foodie's paradise! For this recipe, we are entering the World Showcase and turning left into the Mexico Pavilion. Upon entering the pavilion, we quickly come to [La Cantina de San Angel](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/epcot/cantina-de-san-angel/menus/). At this location, you can choose from many entrées ranging from nachos to tacos. For me, I'm going to choose tacos! Specifically, Tacos de Camarón, or shrimp tacos. This recipe is inspired by that delicious option at EPCOT.
